# Numerical Integration using Cavalieri Simpson methods in Serial and Parallel
## Parallel Numerical Integration - High-Performance Computing
Conducted by: Antonio Cicone, Associate Professor, Department of Information Engineering, Computer Science and Mathematics, University of L'Aquila, Italy

• Implemented serial and parallel versions of the Cavalieri-Simpson numerical integration method for the function f(x) = 6x⁴ - 7x³ + 4x using Fortran and MPI

• Developed a parallel algorithm distributing computational workload across multiple processors, achieving speedup ratios up to 9.23x with 10 processors

• Analyzed performance metrics including execution time, speedup, and efficiency across 1-10 processors with 1,000,000 subintervals

• Achieved high accuracy with approximated integral (2704.77) closely matching exact value (2704.8)

• Demonstrated scalability challenges and communication overhead effects in parallel computing environments
